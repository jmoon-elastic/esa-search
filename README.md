# ESA Search

A lightweight web tool for searching Elastic Stack Security Advisories (ESAs) by deployment version. Enter a target version (8.0.0 and above) and filter matching advisories by product, platform, and severity.

Data is sourced from the official [Elastic Security Announcements](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements/31) forum and stored locally in `esas.json`.

## Features

- **Version search** — Find advisories affecting a specific stack version (e.g. `8.19.11`)
- **Dynamic filters** — Product, platform, and severity options are built automatically from `esas.json`
- **Select all / none** — Quick toggles for each filter category
- **Sort by severity** — Order results by CVSS score (highest first)
- **Direct links** — Each row links to the original ESA announcement on Discuss Elastic

## Project files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `index.html` | Single-page search UI (HTML + Tailwind CSS + vanilla JS) |
| `esas.json` | Crawled advisory database (8.x+ affected ranges) |
| `crawl_esas.py` | Python script to refresh `esas.json` from Discuss Elastic |

## Quick start

The page loads data via `fetch()`, so it must be served over HTTP — opening `index.html` directly as a file (`file://`) will not work.

```bash
cd ESA_search
python3 -m http.server 8765
```

Open [http://localhost:8765/index.html](http://localhost:8765/index.html), enter a version, and click **Search**.

## Refreshing advisory data

Re-crawl the forum and regenerate `esas.json`:

```bash
python3 crawl_esas.py
```

This fetches all ESA topics from the security announcements category, parses affected version ranges (8.0.0+), fixed versions, severity, and platforms, then writes the updated JSON. The crawl takes a few minutes.

After updating, reload the page — filter options will reflect any new products, platforms, or severity levels automatically.

## JSON record format

Each entry in `esas.json` looks like:

```json
{
  "esa_id": "ESA-2026-13",
  "title": "Improper Input Validation in Kibana Leading to Denial of Service",
  "url": "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/...",
  "affected_product": "Kibana",
  "affected_ranges": [">=8.4.0 <=8.19.11", ">=9.0.0 <=9.2.5"],
  "fixed_version": "8.19.12, 9.2.6, 9.3.1",
  "severity": "Medium (6.5)",
  "platforms": ["Elastic Cloud"]
}
```

An advisory with multiple affected version ranges or products may appear as more than one row. Multiple ranges for the same ESA and product are stored together in `affected_ranges`.

## Requirements

- **Browser** — Any modern browser for the UI
- **Python 3** — Standard library only (no pip packages) for `crawl_esas.py`
- **Network access** — Required when running the crawler
